Street Matcher II
===============

### Summary
>Street Matcher II is a card matching game with 18 cards face down and the player has to 
try and find all 9 matching pairs by remembering the position of the cards. SMII was 
independently developed to reinforce my logic and reasoning skills using JavaScript and jQuery. 
This was also my test in preventing intertwined events from causing the onset of insanity.
